# Original LARFDSSOM

### Requirements:

1. You must have a file containing all the paths to the datasets you want to use. You can follow [this](https://github.com/hfbassani/pbml/blob/master/phmb4/Parameters/inputPathsReal) example

2. You must have a parameters file:

   To run LARFDSSOM, we are using ten variables (parameters to the model and other stuff like seed for the rand calls):

   1. a_t
   2. lp
   3. dsbeta
   4. age_wins
   5. e_b
   6. e_n
   7. epsilon_ds
   8. minwd
   9. epochs
   10. seed

   So that you can follow [this](https://github.com/hfbassani/pbml/blob/master/phmb4/Parameters/OrigRealSeed_0) example, where the first ten lines represent the first set of parameters, lines 11 to 20 the second set and continues this way until the last set of parameters.

### Parameters Generation

See [params-gen](https://github.com/hfbassani/pbml/tree/master/params-gen/)

### Running:

1. Make sure you fill the requirements.
2. Open the NetbeansProject with Netbeans
3. Set the arguments for the program:

  ```
  -i: this flag is used to get the path to the file containing all the paths to the datasets to be used.

  -r: this flag is used to get the path to the results folder

  -p: this flag is used to get the path to the parameters file

  -s[optional]: this flag disables the subspace clustering mode. With this flag, each sample will be assigned to a single cluster.

  -f[optional]: this flag disables the noisy filtering and all samples will be assigned to a cluster.
  ```
  For example, to run experiments for [these](https://github.com/hfbassani/pbml/tree/master/Datasets/Realdata) real datasets, you must use -s and -f flags, so that the arguments will be as follows:

  ```
  -i ../../Parameters/inputPathsReal -r teste_orig/ -p ../../Parameters/OrigRealSeed_0 -s
  ```

  After that, you can run your metrics based on the results file.

### Metrics Calculation

See [clustering-analysis](https://github.com/hfbassani/pbml/tree/master/clustering-analysis/)

### You can run the .jar file without the need to open the project. Just follow this [link](https://github.com/hfbassani/pbml/tree/master/Executables).
